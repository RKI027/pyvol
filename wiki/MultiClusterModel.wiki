#summary Description of multiple cluster volatility model in pyvol.

= Introduction =

This document describes the initial model for pyvol is a multiple cluster volatility model in {{{pyvol.sims.MultiClusterSimulator}}}. The purpose of this model is to try to capture an effect known as volatility clustering. As noted by Mandelbrot (1963), "large changes tend to be followed by large changes, of either sign, and small changes tend to be followed by small changes."

The figures below show the autocorrelations of log S&P500 excess *squared* returns on the time scales of days, weeks, months, years. As the figures show, the last day/week/month does a fairly good job of predicting whether the current day/week/month will have large squared returns. Note: this doesn't mean that you can predict the direction of the returns, just the magnitude (i.e., you may know it's likely to be a big day just not whether it is up or down).

Understanding, modeling, and capturing this volatility clustering effect seems important in understanding markets and that is the goal of the multi-cluster model.
